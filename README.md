# Wine Quality Analyzer üç∑  

A machine learning project that analyzes wine quality using **K-Means clustering, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression**. The model predicts wine quality scores, ranks wines based on quality, and determines key factors influencing quality.  

## Features  
‚úÖ **Clustering**: Groups wines into quality categories (Low, Medium, High)  
‚úÖ **Regression**: Predicts wine quality scores  
‚úÖ **Feature Importance**: Identifies key factors affecting quality  
‚úÖ **Probability Distribution**: Estimates batch-wide quality probabilities  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)**  
- **Machine Learning Models**: K-Means, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest  

## Setup Instructions  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Wine-Quality-Analyzer.git
   cd Wine-Quality-Analyzer
